          <h3>Why Tangier?</h3>
          <h2>Tangier, the pearl of Northern Morocco 💎</h2>
          <p>
            Suspended between Africa and Europe, Tangier is a city of light,
            elegance, and quiet intrigue. Overlooking the meeting point of the
            Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, it has captivated artists,
            writers, and travelers for centuries. White façades glow under
            golden sunsets. Mornings begin with sunlight over tiled courtyards.
            Afternoons drift along the Corniche with ocean breezes. Evenings
            unfold in elegant cafés where time slows and conversations linger.
            <br />
            <br />
            The medina whispers stories through its narrow streets scented with
            spices and sea air. Tangier is not just a destination — it is an
            atmosphere of timeless elegance and intrigue. A refined blend of
            Moroccan authenticity and cosmopolitan charm, where history,
            culture, and luxury coexist effortlessly.
            <span>Come for the views. Stay for the feeling. </span>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Salam! I am Chadia, a Belgian with Moroccan roots. I have spent most of
        my vacations in Morocco — especially in Tangier, a city that feels like
        a second home to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Growing up between two cultures has given me a special connection to
        this place. I don’t just see Tangier as a tourist destination — I know
        its rhythm, its flavors, its hidden corners, and the little details that
        make it unique.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through this page, I want to share my favorite spots, memories, and
        recommendations to let you experience Tangier the way I do — not just as
        a visitor, but as someone who truly feels its spirit.
      </p>
      <h3>About this website</h3>
      <p>
        I have created this webpage as part of the SheCodes Responsive Add-on
        course to further develop my coding skills while sharing a place that
        means a lot to me.
