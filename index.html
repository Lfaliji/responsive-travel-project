      <h3>Why Tangier?</h3>
      <h2>Tanger, the pearl of Northern Morocco</h2>
      <p>
        Suspended between Africa and Europe, Tangier is a city of light,
        elegance, and quiet intrigue. Overlooking the meeting point of the
        Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, it has captivated artists,
        writers, and travelers for centuries. White façades glow under golden
        sunsets.
        <br />
        The medina whispers stories through its narrow streets scented with
        spices and sea air. Tangier is not just a destination — it is an
        atmosphere. A refined blend of Moroccan authenticity and cosmopolitan
        charm, where history, culture, and luxury coexist effortlessly. Come for
        the views. Stay for the feeling.

      <h3>Café Hafa</h3>
      <p>
        Perched dramatically above the Strait of Gibraltar, Café Hafa is one of
        Tangier’s most iconic cafés. Since 1921, it has welcomed artists,
        travelers, and dreamers to its white-and-blue cliffside terraces
        overlooking the sea. The setting is simple yet breathtaking, with
        panoramic views stretching toward Spain.
        <br />
        Address:
        <br />
        Rue Hafa, Tangier 90030, Morocco
        <br />
        What I like about it:
        <br />
        The view is unforgettable. I love arriving just before sunset, ordering
        traditional mint tea, and watching the light slowly fade over the water.
        It’s peaceful, timeless, and feels like a moment suspended between
        continents.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Salam! I am Chadia, a Belgian with Moroccan roots, who has spent most of
        her vacations in Morocco — especially in Tangier, a city that feels like
        a second home to me.
        <br />

        Growing up between two cultures has given me a special connection to
        this place. I don’t just see Tangier as a tourist destination — I know
        its rhythm, its flavors, its hidden corners, and the little details that
        make it unique.

        recommendations to help you experience Tangier the way I do — not just
        as a visitor, but as someone who truly feels its spirit.
